Purpose:
-----------
This repository contains IPython Notebooks and Python files that document methods that summarize and visualize the National Fish Habitat Partnership's (NFHP) National Inland Assessment of Fish Habitats (2015)
to ecological and jurisdictional boundaries that may be relevant to fisheries management decisions (e.g. National Park Boundaries, Hydrological Units, States).  
Use this link to find out more about the NFHP source data being used in these efforts: https://doi.org/10.5066/F73R0R1P.  The source data include habitat condition indicies and landscape disturbances that influence
fish habitat at 4 spatial scales (i.e. local catchment, network catchment, local catchment buffer, and network catchment buffers) for over 2 million stream segments of the National Hydrography Plus Version 1 datasets within 
the conterminous United States. 

This repository currently provides methods of summarizing information to spatial units of interest in the notebook: nfhp-2015-hci-summarized-using-midpoint.ipynb	  	  

This repository currently provides methods of visualizing summarized NFHP data in the following ways.	  
	1. Display total kilometers of NHDPlusV1 streams being scored by NFHP within a spatial unit (nfhp-2015-hci-total-stream-km-scored-per-spatial-unit.ipynb)	  
	2. Display length-weighted averages of fish habitat condition indicies for a given spatial unit. (nfhp-2015-place-name-summaries.ipynb)	  
	3. Display disturbance variables that influenced fish habitat condition within a given spatial unit. (nfhp-2015-table-of-significant-disturbances-per-spatial-unit.ipynb)
